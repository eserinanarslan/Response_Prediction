191150,Julia,"Meet Julia, a 34-year-old woman living in the scenic region of code 410. Julia enjoys the convenience of city life despite not holding a driver’s license, navigating her day-to-day activities primarily through public transportation and rideshares. Until recently, Julia had not felt the need for personal vehicle insurance, as she was not a vehicle owner. However, this changed two months ago when she inherited a well-maintained 4-year-old sedan from her aunt. Although Julia has yet to experience any vehicle damage—thankfully avoiding the urban area's bustling traffic mishaps—she has become acutely aware of the potential risks. As a result, she's started exploring insurance options to protect her newfound asset. Navigating the insurance landscape, Julia connected with a vibrant insurance firm through a special outreach program under the anonymized Policy Sales Channel 88, known for their personalized service over the phone. The company quoted her an annual premium of $1,250. Eager to secure her vehicle, and with 60 days of interaction with the company, Julia is on the brink of transforming from an uninsured new vehicle owner into a protected client, appreciating the tailored guidance provided by her insurance advisor.",0.02804,0.13413,0.0,0.0,0.01076,0.3664064947015065,0,0,0
